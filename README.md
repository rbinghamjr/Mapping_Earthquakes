# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
In this project, Leaflet was used to create a layered image that shows earthquake activity around the world.

## Results
There are 3 layers added to this map.
- First layer displays tectonic plates as lines on the map
- Second layer shows all earthquakes in circle markers sized by magnitude
- Third layer shows major earthquakes

There are also 3 different map syles the user can generate.
- First is street mode (default layer)
